# Health Insurance Excel EDA Project

##  Project Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a U.S. health insurance dataset.  
The goal is to understand how factors such as **age, BMI, sex, region, smoking status**, and **children** influence insurance charges.

All analysis was completed in **Excel**, using:
- Data cleaning techniques  
- Feature engineering  
- PivotTables  
- PivotCharts  
- Dashboarding  

This project demonstrates foundational analytical skills required for business analyst and data analyst roles.

##  Dataset
**File:** insurance.csv  
**Rows:** 1,338  
**Columns:** 7  

**Features:**

##  Data Cleaning Steps
- Formatted values into proper data types  
- Removed duplicates  
- Standardized column formatting  
- Added new derived fields (e.g., **Age Groups**, **BMI Categories**)  
- Highlighted outliers using conditional formatting  
- Ensured dataset completeness

##  Analysis Conducted
### Key PivotTables:
- **Average charges by age group**
- **Charges by BMI category**
- **Charges by smoker status**
- **Breakdowns by gender, children, and region**

### Visualizations:
- Bar charts showing the impact of smoking on insurance cost  
- BMI vs. charges trend  
- Regional cost differences  
- A full dashboard summarizing major insights

##  Key Insights
- **Smokers pay significantly higher charges** than non-smokers.  
- **Higher BMI is strongly associated with higher insurance charges.**  
- **Age is a major cost driver**, especially after age 40.  
- The **Southeast region** generally shows the highest average charges.  
- Gender and children count had less dramatic impact compared to BMI and smoking.
